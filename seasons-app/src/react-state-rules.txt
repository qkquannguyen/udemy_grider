------------------------------------------- State Rules -------------------------------------------
    1. Only usable with class components
    2. You will confuse props with state
    3. 'State' is a JS Object that contains data relevant to a component(s)
    4. Updating 'state' on a component causes the component to (almost) instantly rerender
        - Solves the geolocation problem of rerendering
    5. State must be initialized when a component is created
    6. State can ONLY be updated using the function 'setState'
